        A natural curiosity has always driven me to understand how things work.
        As a child, I couldn't resist taking apart toys to see what made them
        tick. This fascination with the technical world has only grown stronger
        with time. Today, instead of toys, I'm delving into the fascinating
        world of <strong>software development</strong>. And the best part? I'm
        not just dissecting code â€“ I'm building and creating new applications
        from the ground up!
        <br />
        <br />
        My passion lies in <strong>full-stack development </strong>, where I
        thrive on tackling both the front-end and back-end aspects of web
        applications. On the front-end, I love crafting user-friendly and
        visually appealing interfaces using technologies like{" "}
        <strong>React</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong>,{" "}
        <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>. My
        back-end skills involve building robust and scalable applications using
        frameworks like <strong>Laravel</strong> and <strong>Node.js</strong>.
        <br />
        <br />
        In addition to full-stack development, I'm also passionate about
        exploring mobile development with <strong>Flutter</strong> and{" "}
        <strong>Kotlin</strong>. I'm constantly intrigued by the potential of{" "}
        <strong>data science</strong> and its ability to unlock new insights
        from data.
